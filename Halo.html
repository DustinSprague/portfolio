          <h3>Why is Halo my favorite</h3>
          <p>Halo is my favorite because of the story, the music and the gameplay. Halo's story is about an interstellar war between humanity and an allicance of aliens known as the Covenant. Every Halo game has great music that allways goes with the tone of your current setting. Halo revolutionized fps games and is the reason for why fps is now so good.</p>
